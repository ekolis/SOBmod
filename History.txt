Version History - Sort of Balanceish Mod for Space Empires V
================================================================

v1.0
------------------------------
Added:
	- Racial colony modules. If you don't have the appropriate homeworld type then colony modules will cost twice as much and take up twice as much space.
		- This should help cut down on colony spam, especially in late game when players are trading colony techs.
Changed:
	- Enabled slot overrides for more balanced vehicle component layouts.
	- Enabled use of stock shipsets.
	- Reorganized design types to get rid of duplicates and add a few that were missing.
Removed:
	- Shipsets and ministers - this mod is not intended to be compatible with any AI.
	- Organic and crystalline hulls - they don't add much to the game but make editing the mod more difficult.
	- Life support component, to avoid clickiness in ship design. Merged its ability into crew quarters.
Fixed:
	- Nothing to speak of!
