Version History - Sort of Balanceish Mod for Space Empires V
================================================================

v1.0
------------------------------
Added:
	- Racial colony modules. If you don't have the appropriate homeworld type then colony modules will cost twice as much and take up twice as much space.
		- This should help cut down on colony spam, especially in late game when players are trading colony techs.
Changed:
	- Enabled slot overrides for more balanced vehicle component layouts.
	- Enabled use of stock shipsets.
	- Reorganized design types to get rid of duplicates and add a few that were missing.
	- Hulls no longer get bigger as they level up; instead they gain other bonuses (such as reduced maintenance).
	- Reworked emergency supply/ordnance to make it less micromanagey: it is now much larger and also stores some supplies/ordnance.
		- Intended for use on dedicated supply/ordnance tankers, or heavy ships that you won't be building too many of.
		- No longer one per ship, if you have space.
Removed:
	- Shipsets and ministers - this mod is not intended to be compatible with any AI.
	- Organic and crystalline hulls - they don't add much to the game but make editing the mod more difficult.
	- Life support component, to avoid clickiness in ship design. Merged its ability into crew quarters.
Fixed:
	- Nothing to speak of!
